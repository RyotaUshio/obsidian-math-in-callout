# Obsidian Sample Plugin

This is a modified version of https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin.

- `*.ts` files are put in the `src` directory
- The plugin class definition and settings-related code are separated into `main.ts` and `settings.ts`
- Release GitHub action is already there
  - Don't forget to go to `Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions` and turn on `Read and write permissions`
